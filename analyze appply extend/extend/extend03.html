            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>

            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>It is important to use descriptive file names for image files because then you won't mix up any images with the wrong ones and it speeds up the processes since you don't need to open each one to check you have the right one.</p>

            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>I used Paint to resize the image.</p>

            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The original size of the image was around 10,000x6000, I don't have the exact numbers because I saved my changes from the step above.  </p>

            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5.jpg.jpg" alt="Hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="500" width="333">

            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p></p>

            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5_min.jpg" alt="hand writing HTML 5 on glass" height="500" width="333">

            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>Both images look exactly the same for me and I used both compressors provided in the book, for both they looked exactly the same.</p>

                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
                <p>I used W3Schools Tryit Editor for SVG images to help make the code for my SVG image.</p>
